# pantip_scraper
# Created by DarkDrag0nite

This is web scraper for pantip written in python.
To use:
python pantipScraper.py start_topic_id_here

The data will be store in pantip_storage as JSON.
Right now it could extract
- topic name
- author
- story
- like Count
- emotion Count
- emotions (count of each types)
- tags
- comments count

Limitations:
- no image being extracts
- no poll information and topic with poll might be extracted incorrectly
- no comments yet

I haven't set up comment part yet but very soon I will.

# Credit, Feedback, Suggestion is appreciated.
